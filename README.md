This is a starting point for TypeScript solutions to the
["Build an AI-Powered Commit Message Generator" Challenge](https://app.vizh.ai/challenges/build-git-ai-commit).

In this challenge, you'll build a professional CLI tool that generates intelligent 
commit messages using AI. Along the way, you'll learn about CLI development, Git 
integration, OpenAI API usage, and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[vizh.ai](https://vizh.ai) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your CLI implementation is in `src/index.ts`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin main
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `node (20+)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/index.ts`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin main` to submit your solution
   to Vizh.ai. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
